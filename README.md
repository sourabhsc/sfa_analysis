Diversity investment trends in business firms using SFA analysis

* A project to identify diversity investement trends in business firms.
We have three different diversities :- 
* operational diversity
* technical diversity
* employee diversity 

+ Technical diversity is found out using data mining of patents of a given firm. Check out 'patents_mining.ipynb'. 
+ Theoretical diversity trends using SFA are presented in images folders.
+ Linear Regression results for the diversity trends are shown in 'trends_regression.ipynb' 

SFA analysis is done using the R software package available here:-

Updated codes with full results will be updated soon.
